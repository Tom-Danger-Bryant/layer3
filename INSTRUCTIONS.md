# Layer3 - Code Project

## **Overview**

This take-home code project is for candidates applying for an engineering position at Layer3. Your task is to create a web app with a user interface that allows users to browse the top users of Layer3.

## **Assignment**

At Layer3, we have a leaderboard where the most active users compete to be at the top. Your task is to create a web app that has the following features:

1. A list of the top users of Layer3
2. A view of a user's details

The API endpoint provides basic info about each user, such as their address, XP, and username, which you can use however you like.

On the user page, we invite you to be creative and think of some fantastic on-chain data you can pull in and show. Some suggestions include:

- Fetching the balance of the user on different chains
- Getting the latest transactions using the Etherscan API
- Showing the user's NFTs

We value creative ideas and attention to detail. Break the rules if you see fit. 

## **Implementation**

We suggest using Next.js or a simple React starter with Vite to get up and running quickly but feel free to use whatever you're comfortable with and see fit and use whatever coding style or third-party libraries you think are appropriate.

## Documentation

Feel free to include a [`PROJECT.md`](http://PROJECT.md) file in the repository with things we should know about your implementation, including how to start it up, run tests, trade-offs, what else you would do, etc.

## **API Information**

- **API endpoint:** https://layer3.xyz/api/assignment/users

## **Submitting Your Code**

Once you've completed the test, send us a link to a git repo (either make it public or invite @petersng, @comua, and @larskarbo to it). We will review and get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks and we appreciate you and your interest in joining the Layer3 team!
